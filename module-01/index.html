<h2>My reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h2>
<h2>First off, I find myself caught between the Cartographer and the Coder.  While I embrace new mapping technologies such as ESRI,
        CartoDB, QGIS, etc., I am a bit behind on some of the coding and code built web maps.  I am conscience of the effect a map can
        have on the end user.  I do try and abide by the “cartographer ethical code” of using proper classification breaks,
        normalization of datasets, and minimizing visual bias.  However, I do see and understand that each map, especially data driven
        thematic maps, can and will show some sort of bias of either the map maker, or data provider.  Reducing this inherent bias is
        an important and respected attribute of the cartographer.  As I become more proficient with coding and web based mapping, I can
        maintain that “ethical code”.
    My priority as I continue my career is accuracy.  Right now, I am working in the field, doing surveying.  Once complete, I take the surveyed data back to the lab.  I need accuracy.  I make and maintain maps for a railroad company, so right now, that is my thing,
    accuracy.
    Manifesto point 4, for me, is important.  While I enjoy the design aspect of creating maps, sometimes simple is best.  Sometimes,
    simple is “ugly”.  I love the map in figure 7, tweeted by the Canadian delegation to NATO in response to the Russian invasion of
    Eastern Ukraine in 2014.  Simple, yes.  Ugly, perhaps, yes.  Not every map has to be an elaborate birthday cake with flowers made
    from icing and fancy cursive writing.  That map adds a certain understated humor and simplicity to a humorless and complex
    situation.  I guess what I am trying to say, is sometimes as a cartographer, design can over complicate and muddy a simple point
    one is trying to convey.  I like pretty maps as much as the next guy, but sometimes….
